## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: GitHub Repository
1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Initialize git and push code:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Step 2: Netlify Deployment
1. Go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/)
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Connect your GitHub account
4. Select your repository
5. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
6. Click "Deploy site"

### Step 3: Post-Deployment
1. Test the deployed site
2. Check all pages load correctly
3. Test contact form functionality
4. Verify responsive design
5. Check performance scores

## 🔧 Environment Variables (Optional)

If you need to add environment variables for the contact form:

1. In Netlify dashboard, go to Site settings > Environment variables
2. Add any required API keys or configuration
3. Redeploy the site

## 📝 Notes

- The project uses Vite for fast builds
- Tailwind CSS is configured for production optimization
- TypeScript ensures type safety
- Netlify functions are ready for form handling
- SPA routing is configured with fallback to index.html

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Build fails**: Check Node.js version (18+ recommended)
2. **Missing dependencies**: Run `npm install` locally first
3. **TypeScript errors**: Fix all type errors before deploying
4. **Netlify functions**: Ensure proper ES module syntax

### Performance Tips:
- Images are optimized automatically by Vite
- CSS is minified and purged
- JavaScript is tree-shaken and minified
- Fonts are preloaded for better performance
